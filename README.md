# Knowledge Graph Web Application

## Welcome!
KnowledgeGraph is a full-stack web application for visually organizing and exploring information as a network of interconnected nodes and relationships. Designed to help users externalize and analyze complex knowledge, it features a modern React frontend, a robust Spring Boot backend, and a flexible GraphQL API powered by a local SQLite database.


## KnowledgeGraph's Vision
Information is most powerful when connected. KnowledgeGraph aims to make learning and research a compounding activity by mapping ideas, facts, and concepts as a graph—helping you see relationships, discover patterns, and grow your knowledge network over time.


## Features
- **Interactive Graph Exploration** — Explore and manipulate nodes and relationships in a dynamic, visually engaging graph.

- **Search & Discovery** — Find nodes by title or keyword for quick navigation.

- **CRUD operations** — Create, read, update, and delete nodes and relationships with ease.

- **User Authentication** — Secure login, registration, and JWT-based session management.

- **Personalized Knowledge Graphs** — Each user can build and manage their own private graph.

- **GraphQL API** — Flexible queries and mutations for frontend and external integrations.


## Technologies

- **React** - Handles the user presentation and experience in the frontend
- **SpringBoot (Java)** — Implements the backend operations, including server logic, resolvers, ORMs, etc.
- **GraphQL API** — Serves as a query and mutation handler between frontend and backend
- **JWT** — Serves as primary authentication handler
- **SQLite Database** — Manages local data storage, including nodes and relationships
